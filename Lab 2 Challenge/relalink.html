Almost heaven, West Virginia</a>
<br>Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
<br>Life is old there, older than the trees
<br>Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
<br>Country roads, take me home
<br>To the place I belong
<br>West Virginia, mountain mama
<br>Take me home, country roads
<br>All my memories gather round her
<br>Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
<br>Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
<br>Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
<br>Country roads, take me home
<br>To the place I belong
<br>West Virginia, mountain mama
<br>Take me home, country roads
<br>I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
<br>The radio reminds me of my home far away
<br>And driving down the road I get a feeling
<br>That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
<br>Country roads, take me home
<br>To the place I belong
<br>West Virginia, mountain mama
<br>Take me home, country roads
<br>Country roads, take me home
<br>To the place I belong
<br>West Virginia, mountain mama
<br>Take me home, country roads
<br>Take me home, down country roads
<br>Take me home, down country roads
